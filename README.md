# p5 sketches

A collections of p5 sketches i made over the years, these are mostly a showcase. view them ~~[here](https://zoasr.github.io/p5-sketches)~~**(not yet deployed)**

Most of these sketches are inspired by [Daniel shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/about), a creative coder and teacher, i owe most if not all of what i learned on creative coding and computer graphics to him on his youtube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) and i recommend everyone to follow his work

## Get Started

Get started on their [github repo](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) to try out the library for yourself.

this multipage app is built using [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/), [`react`](https://react.dev/), [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [`react router`](https://reactrouter.com/)

to run this locally, you need to have `node` installed on your machine, clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZOASR/p5-sketches.git
```

and run

```shell
npm install; npm run dev
```

this will spin up a local server on port `5173`, open it in your browser: http://localhost:5173/
