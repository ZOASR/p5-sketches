# p5 sketches

A collections of p5 sketches i made over the years, these are mostly a showcase.

Most of these sketches are inspired by [Daniel shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/about), a creative coder and teacher, i owe most if not all of what i learned on creative coding and computer graphics to him on his youtube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) and i recommend everyone to follow his work
